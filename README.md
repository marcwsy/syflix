# syflix

this project is a modified version of the library project from the odin project curriculum

we were to practice object oriented programming

i used classes to create the objects, created dom elements from the users input of their favorite films, used a few functions to add them to the local storage

used some W3school functions to help with added functionality such as a search bar and sorting by titles and ratings
